# helloworld

# Overview

As a budding software developer with aspirations in Android app development, I'm starting with the basics to build a solid foundation in Kotlin. This simple "Hello World" program marks the first step in my journey toward creating powerful and user-friendly mobile applications.

This software is a console-based Kotlin application developed in IntelliJ IDEA. When executed, it prints the message “Hello World” to the console. 

My purpose for creating this software is to become comfortable with Kotlin as a programming language, and to set up a development workflow that I can build upon as I move toward more complex Android applications.
